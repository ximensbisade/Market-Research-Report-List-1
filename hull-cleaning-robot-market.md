<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hull Cleaning Robot Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-autonomous</li><li>Autonomous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hull cleaning robot market is divided into two main types: semi-autonomous and autonomous systems. Semi-autonomous robots require some human intervention, allowing operators to control the cleaning process while still benefiting from automated features. In contrast, autonomous robots operate independently, using advanced sensors and algorithms to navigate and clean hulls without human input. Both types enhance efficiency and reduce labor costs, but autonomous systems offer greater operational freedom and continuous cleaning capabilities, catering to diverse marine maintenance needs.</p></p>
