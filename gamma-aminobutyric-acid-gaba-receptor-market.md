<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) Receptor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>GABA-A Receptor</li><li>GABA-B Receptor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The GABA receptor market is primarily divided into two types: GABA-A and GABA-B receptors. GABA-A receptors are ionotropic receptors that mediate fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain, often targeted by anxiolytic drugs and anesthetics. In contrast, GABA-B receptors are metabotropic and facilitate slower, prolonged inhibitory responses, playing a role in muscle relaxation and modulation of neurotransmitter release. Both receptor types are crucial for developing therapeutic agents for neurological and psychiatric disorders, impacting demand in the pharmaceutical industry.</p></p>
