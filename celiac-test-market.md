<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Celiac Test Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Serologic Test</li><li>Genetic Testing</li><li>Small-Bowel Biopsy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The celiac test market comprises three main types: serologic tests, genetic testing, and small-bowel biopsy. Serologic tests detect specific antibodies in the blood, indicating an immune response to gluten. Genetic testing identifies the presence of genes associated with celiac disease, such as HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8, helping assess risk. Small-bowel biopsy involves examining tissue samples from the intestine to confirm damage caused by gluten intake, providing a definitive diagnosis. Together, these tests facilitate accurate celiac disease detection and management.</p></p>
