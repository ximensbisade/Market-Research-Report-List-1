<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-etching Adhesive</li><li>Selective-etching Adhesive</li><li>Total-etching Adhesive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dental adhesives market is segmented into three main types: self-etching, selective-etching, and total-etching adhesives. Self-etching adhesives bond by simultaneously etching and priming the tooth surface, simplifying application. Selective-etching adhesives involve etching enamel only, promoting stronger adhesion while preserving dentin integrity. Total-etching adhesives require separate etching of both enamel and dentin, providing excellent bonding strength but requiring more steps. Each type caters to specific clinical needs, influencing dental restoration efficiency and patient outcomes.</p></p>
