<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ocular Inserts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soluble Inserts</li><li>Insoluble Inserts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ocular inserts are drug delivery systems designed for sustained-release medication in the eye. Soluble inserts dissolve over time, releasing the drug directly into the ocular surface, enhancing therapeutic effects with minimal side effects. Insoluble inserts, on the other hand, provide prolonged drug release without dissolving, allowing for extended therapeutic action. Both types serve to improve patient compliance, reduce the frequency of dosing, and enhance the effectiveness of treatment for various ocular conditions.</p></p>
