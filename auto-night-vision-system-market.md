<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Auto Night Vision System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active System</li><li>Passive System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Auto Night Vision System market is primarily classified into two types: active and passive systems. Active systems use infrared light sources to illuminate the environment, enhancing visibility in complete darkness. They typically require a light source, which can be detected by sensors but is not visible to the naked eye. In contrast, passive systems rely on ambient light, including thermal radiation and moonlight, to produce images. Both systems enhance nighttime driving safety but employ different technologies for illumination and detection.</p></p>
