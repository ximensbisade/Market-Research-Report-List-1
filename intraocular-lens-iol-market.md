<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intraocular Lens (IOL) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-foldable lenses</li><li>Foldable Intraocular Lens</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Intraocular Lens (IOL) market is primarily categorized into non-foldable and foldable lenses. Non-foldable lenses are rigid, made from materials like PMMA, and are typically used in larger surgical incisions. They offer durability but are limited in their adaptability. In contrast, foldable intraocular lenses can be compressed for insertion through smaller incisions, enhancing surgical precision and reducing recovery time. This flexibility has led to their widespread adoption in modern cataract surgeries, driving innovation and market growth.</p></p>
